One of my biggest professional challenges was when I was an intern and I needed to develop a whole system to generate payroll for the university where I studied, the project was called Labore.
I had to gather requirements, develop the code in PHP, model the database, implement the system in the sectors, support users and write documentation.
This was one of the biggest challenges of my career because I was still learning to program and I had to do a lot of research and learn to develop a complete system. That's why I'm very proud of this project, for being able to develop the project.
